/-! # Recursive Doubling Allreduce Verification

This file verifies the recursive doubling allreduce algorithm from
mpich_civl/allreduce_intra_recursive_doubling.c (lines 90-119).

The verification focuses on the actual algorithm mechanics:
- XOR partner calculation (dst = rank ^ mask)
- Mask progression (0x1 → 0x2 → 0x4 → 0x8 → ...)
- Atomic sendrecv operations
- Commutativity handling in reduction
- Consensus through coordinated reduction

Abstractions: datatypes, buffer management, error handling, non-power-of-2 cases

-- **Types**

-- Process identifiers (ranks 0, 1, 2, 3, ... up to comm_size-1)
type proc

-- Data values being reduced
type value

-- **Abstract Operations**

-- The reduction operation (models MPIR_Reduce_local)
-- Trusted black box that combines two values
immutable function reduce_op : value → value → value

-- Each process has an immutable input value
immutable function input_value : proc → value

-- **Algorithm Parameters**

-- Total number of processes (assumed to be power of 2)
immutable function comm_size : Unit → Nat

-- Whether the reduction operation is commutative
immutable function is_commutative : Unit → Bool

-- **Core State Relations**

-- Process p currently holds value v
relation has_value (p : proc) (v : value)

-- Process p has received value v from partner but hasn't reduced yet
relation received_value (p : proc) (v : value)

-- Current mask value in the algorithm (0x1, 0x2, 0x4, 0x8, ...)
relation current_mask (mask : Nat)

-- Process p has completed the current round
relation completed_round (p : proc)

-- Process p has completed the entire algorithm
relation completed_algorithm (p : proc)

-- Process p is participating in the allreduce
relation participating (p : proc)
